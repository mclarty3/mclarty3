# Hi, I'm Ryan :)
Programmer, musician, player and creator of video games

## About Me
I graduated from Fordham University in 2022 with my bachelor's and master's in computer science, with a concentration in artificial intelligence.

Professionally, I'm experienced with full-stack development, time series forecasting, and LLM integrations including RAG-based chatbots, as well as copious amounts of internal tool development with python, bash, awscli, and docker.

Away from the computer, I like to: 
- 📖 read (typically nonfiction, though I'm currently really enjoying The Three Body Problem)
- 🎺 play music (I play the trumpet and mess around on the keyboard)
- 🛹 skate
- 🍴 try new eateries around the city
## 🛠 Skills
- I use daily: `python` `sklearn` `pandas` `css`
- I know my way around: `c#` `html` `javascript` `lua`
- I've dabbled with: `c++` `java` `bash`
