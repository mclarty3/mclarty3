# Hi, I'm Ryan :)
Programmer, musician, player and creator of video games

## About Me
I'm a recent graduate from Fordham University. I received my Bachelor's in Computer
Science with a minor in Mathematics in 2021, and completed my Master's in C.S. with
a concentration in A.I. in 2022.

I currently work as an Analyst Developer for Gro Intelligence, a climate and agriculture
data startup in NYC. I perform analysis on large and diverse datasets, and build interactive
web applications to visualize and allow users to interact with the data.

Away from the computer, I like to: 
- 📖 read (typically nonfiction, though I'm currently really enjoying The Three Body Problem)
- 🎺 play music (I play the trumpet and mess around on the keyboard)
- 🛹 skate
- 🍴 try new eateries around the city.
## 🛠 Skills
- I use daily: `python` `pandas` `css`
- I know my way around: `c#` `html` `javascript` `lua`
- I've dabbled with: `c++` `java` `bash`
